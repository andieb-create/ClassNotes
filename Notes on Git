I just watched a youtube on github andf im trying to figure out how to use this correctly and laern that i can come back and save things 
you can use this to collaberate with other coders and save projects here to come back and look at like a saving spot in a game
this is where you create a version history that you can see changes and where it was edited and deleted with date and time stamps
